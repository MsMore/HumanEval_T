Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```python
def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    numbers.sort()
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = None
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        diff = numbers[i] - numbers[i-1]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i-1], numbers[i])
    return closest_pair
```

This function first sorts the list of numbers. Then it iterates through the sorted list, calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers. If the difference is smaller than the smallest difference found so far, it updates the smallest difference and the closest pair of numbers. Finally, it returns the closest pair of numbers.

This solution assumes that the input list contains at least two numbers. If the list contains only one number or is empty, the function will raise an error.

        diff = numbers[i] - numbers[i-1]

            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i-1], numbers[i])
    return closest_pair

Here's a solution to find the closest elements in a list of numbers:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """ From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each other
    and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
    (2.0, 2.2)
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
    (2.0, 2.0)
    """
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (0.0, 0.0)
    
    # Sort the list to make comparison easier
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    
    # Compare adjacent numbers in the sorted list
    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers) - 1):
        current_diff = sorted_numbers[i + 1] - sorted_numbers[i]
        if current_diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = current_diff
            closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[i], sorted_numbers[i + 1])
    
    return closest_pair
```

This solution works as follows:

1. We define variables to keep track of the minimum difference found (`min_diff`) and the closest pair of numbers (`closest_pair`).

2. We sort the input list to make it easier to find the closest numbers (adjacent numbers in a sorted list are potential candidates for the closest pair).

3. We iterate through the sorted list, comparing each number with the next one.

4. For each pair of adjacent numbers, we calculate their difference and update `min_diff` and `closest_pair` if we find a smaller difference.

5. Finally, we return the closest pair as a tuple with the smaller number first.

The solution handles both cases where the closest numbers are different (like 2.0 and 2.2) and cases where there are identical numbers in the list (like 2.0 and 2.0).

Time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input list.

Example usage:
```python
>>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
(2.0, 2.2)
>>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
(2.0, 2.0)
>>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.8])
(2.8, 3.0)
```

Here is a Python function that solves the problem:

    and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.

    Returns:
        Tuple[float, float]: The two closest numbers in ascending order.
    """
    
    # Check if the input list has at least two elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("The input list must have at least two elements")

    # Sort the list of numbers
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)

    # Initialize the minimum difference and the closest pair
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = None

    # Iterate over the sorted list to find the closest pair

    return closest_pair

# Test the function
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))  # Expected output: (2.0, 2.2)

```

This function works by sorting the input list of numbers and then iterating over the sorted list to find the pair with the smallest difference. The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the length of the input list.
