Here is the Python code for the problem:

```python
def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    sum_numbers = sum(numbers)
    product_numbers = 1
    for number in numbers:
        product_numbers *= number
    return sum_numbers, product_numbers
```

This function first calculates the sum of all numbers in the list using the built-in `sum` function. Then it calculates the product of all numbers by iterating over the list and multiplying each number with the previous product (initialized as 1). Finally, it returns a tuple of the sum and the product.

    sum_numbers = sum(numbers)
    product_numbers = 1
    for number in numbers:
        product_numbers *= number
    return sum_numbers, product_numbers

Here's the Python code to calculate the sum and product of a list of integers:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """
    if not numbers:  # If the list is empty
        return (0, 1)
    
    total_sum = sum(numbers)  # Calculate sum of all numbers
    
    # Calculate product of all numbers
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    
    return (total_sum, product)
```

This solution:

1. First checks if the input list is empty. If it is, returns (0, 1) as specified in the requirements.

2. If the list is not empty:
   - Calculates the sum using Python's built-in `sum()` function
   - Calculates the product by iterating through the list and multiplying all numbers together

3. Returns a tuple containing both the sum and product

The function handles both test cases:
- For empty list `[]`, returns `(0, 1)`
- For list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, returns `(10, 24)` because:
  - Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
  - Product = 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24

You can also use it with any other list of integers:
```python
print(sum_product([2, 3, 5]))  # Returns (10, 30)
print(sum_product([1]))  # Returns (1, 1)
print(sum_product([-1, 2, -3]))  # Returns (-2, 6)
```

Here is a simple and efficient solution in Python:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.

    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """

    # Initialize sum and product with their neutral elements
    total_sum = 0
    total_product = 1

    # Iterate over the list of numbers
    for num in numbers:
        # Add each number to the total sum
        total_sum += num
        
        # Multiply each number to the total product
        total_product *= num
    
    # Return a tuple containing the sum and the product
    return total_sum, total_product

# Test cases
print(sum_product([]))  # Expected output: (0, 1)
print(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected output: (10, 24)
```

However, if you want a more concise version using the `sum` and `math.prod` functions:

```python
fromimport math
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.

    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """

    # Calculate the sum of numbers
    total_sum = sum(numbers)

    # Calculate the product of numbers, with a default value of 1 for empty lists
    total_product = math.prod(numbers, start=1) if numbers else 1
    
    # Return a tuple containing the sum and the product
    return total_sum, total_product

# Test cases
print(sum_product([]))  # Expected output: (0, 1)
print(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected output: (10, 24)
```
