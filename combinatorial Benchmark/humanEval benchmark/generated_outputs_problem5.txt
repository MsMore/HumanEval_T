Here is the Python code for calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers:

```python
def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    return sum(abs(x - mean) for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
```

This function first calculates the mean of the input numbers, then calculates the absolute difference between each number and the mean, and finally returns the average of these absolute differences.

**Extracted Code:**
def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    return sum(abs(x - mean) for x in numbers) / len(numbers)

Here's a Python solution for calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation:

```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of the dataset.
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    
    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): List of input numbers
        
    Returns:
        float: Mean Absolute Deviation
        
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """
    # Check if the list is empty
    if not numbers:
        return 0.0
    
    # Calculate the mean of the dataset
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    # Calculate absolute differences from mean and take their average
    absolute_differences = [abs(x - mean) for x in numbers]
    mad = sum(absolute_differences) / len(numbers)
    
    return mad
```

This solution works as follows:

1. First, we check if the input list is empty. If it is, we return 0.0.

2. We calculate the mean (average) of the dataset using `sum(numbers) / len(numbers)`.

3. For each number in the input list, we:
   - Calculate its difference from the mean
   - Take the absolute value of this difference
   This is done using a list comprehension: `[abs(x - mean) for x in numbers]`

4. Finally, we calculate the average of these absolute differences to get the Mean Absolute Deviation.

The function handles cases like:
```python
>>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
1.0
>>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0])
0.0
>>> mean_absolute_deviation([])
0.0
>>> mean_absolute_deviation([2.0])
0.0
```

The function follows the formula MAD = average|x - x_mean| where:
- x represents each value in the dataset
- x_mean is the mean (average) of all values
- |...| represents the absolute value
- average is taken over all absolute differences

The solution is efficient with O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input list, as it needs to iterate through the list twice (once for mean calculation and once for absolute differences).

Here is a high-quality, readable, and well-documented Python solution using NumPy library:
```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of a given list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The Mean Absolute Deviation.
    """
    # Convert the input list to a NumPy array for efficient computations
    numbers_array = np.array(numbers)

    # Calculate the mean of the input numbers
    mean_value = np.mean(numbers_array)

    # Calculate the absolute differences between each element and the mean
    absolute_diffs = np.abs(numbers_array - mean_value)

    # Calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation as the average of the absolute differences
    mad = np.mean(absolute_diffs)

    return mad

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: 1.0
```
This code uses the NumPy library to efficiently calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation. The solution consists of three main steps:

1. Calculate the mean of the input numbers using `np.mean`.
2. Calculate the absolute differences between each element and the mean using `np.abs` and broadcasting.
3. Calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation as the average of the absolute differences using `np.mean`.

The code includes type hints, docstrings, and comments to ensure readability and maintainability. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with a sample input list.
