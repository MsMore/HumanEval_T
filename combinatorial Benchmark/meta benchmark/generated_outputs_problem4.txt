To solve this problem, you can iterate through the list of operations, updating the balance as you go. If at any point the balance falls below zero, you return `True`. If you finish processing all operations without the balance going below zero, you return `False`. Here's a Python function to achieve this:

```python
def is_balance_negative(operations):
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False

# Example usage:
operations = [100, -50, -60, 20, -10]
print(is_balance_negative(operations))  # Output: True
```

In this code:
- `operations` is a list of integers where positive numbers represent deposits and negative numbers represent withdrawals.
- We initialize `balance` to 0.
- We iterate over each operation, updating the balance.
- If the balance ever becomes negative, we immediately return `True`.
- If the loop completes without the balance going negative, we return `False`.

**Extracted Code:**
def is_balance_negative(operations):
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False

# Example usage:
operations = [100, -50, -60, 20, -10]
print(is_balance_negative(operations))  # Output: True

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def check_balance(operations):
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation.startswith('D'):
            balance += int(operation[1:])
        elif operation.startswith('W'):
            balance -= int(operation[1:])
        
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    
    return False

# Example usage
operations = ['D100', 'D200', 'W50', 'D300']
print(check_balance(operations))  # Output: False

operations = ['D100', 'D200', 'W500', 'D300']
print(check_balance(operations))  # Output: True
```

This code defines a function `check_balance` that takes a list of operations as input and iterates through each operation to update the balance. If the balance falls below zero at any point, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

**Extracted Code:**
def check_balance(operations):
    balance = 0

Here's a Python solution to detect if a bank account balance falls below zero:

```python
def check_negative_balance(operations):
    balance = 0
    
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
            
    return False

# Alternative solution using running sum
def check_negative_balance_alt(operations):
    return any(sum(operations[:i+1]) < 0 for i in range(len(operations)))

# Test cases
def test_check_negative_balance():
    # Test case 1: Balance goes negative
    assert check_negative_balance([100, -200, 100]) == True
    
    # Test case 2: Balance stays positive
    assert check_negative_balance([100, -50, 100, -50]) == False
    
    # Test case 3: Balance becomes exactly zero
    assert check_negative_balance([50, -50]) == False
    
    # Test case 4: Single negative operation
    assert check_negative_balance([-50]) == True
    
    # Test case 5: Empty list
    assert check_negative_balance([]) == False
    
    # Test case 6: Multiple operations leading to negative
    assert check_negative_balance([100, 100, -300, 100]) == True
    
    print("All test cases passed!")

# Run tests
test_check_negative_balance()
```

This solution provides two implementations:

1. `check_negative_balance()`: This is the more efficient solution that:
   - Keeps track of running balance
   - Processes each operation sequentially
   - Returns True as soon as balance goes negative
   - Returns False if balance never goes negative

2. `check_negative_balance_alt()`: An alternative solution using list slicing and sum()
   - More concise but less efficient for large lists
   - Uses running sum to check all intermediate balances

The code includes test cases covering various scenarios:
- Balance going negative
- Balance staying positive
- Balance becoming exactly zero
- Single negative operation
- Empty list
- Multiple operations leading to negative balance

Example usage:
```python
# Example 1
operations1 = [100, -200, 100]  # Goes negative after second operation
print(check_negative_balance(operations1))  # Output: True

# Example 2
operations2 = [100, -50, 100, -50]  # Never goes negative
print(check_negative_balance(operations2))  # Output: False
```

Key points:
1. The function takes a list of integers representing deposits (positive) and withdrawals (negative)
2. It returns True if the balance ever goes below zero
3. It returns False if the balance stays at or above zero throughout
4. Empty list returns False as there are no operations to process
5. The solution is efficient with O(n) time complexity
6. It handles edge cases appropriately

The first implementation is recommended for practical use as it:
- Is more efficient (O(n) time complexity)
- Stops as soon as negative balance is detected
- Uses less memory
- Is more readable and maintainable

**Extracted Code:**
def check_negative_balance(operations):
    balance = 0
    
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
            
    return False

# Alternative solution using running sum

**Detect Negative Balance**
==========================

### Problem Statement

Given a list of operations representing bank account deposits and withdrawals, detect if the balance falls below zero at any point, and return `True` if it does, otherwise return `False`.

### Solution
```python
def has_negative_balance(operations):
    """
    Detects if the balance falls below zero at any point.

    Args:
        operations (list): List of integers representing deposits (+) and withdrawals (-)

    Returns:
        bool: True if balance falls below zero, False otherwise
    """
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
### Example Use Cases

```python
# Test case 1: Balance never falls below zero
operations = [100, -50, 20, -30]
print(has_negative_balance(operations))  # Output: False

# Test case 2: Balance falls below zero
operations = [100, -150, 20, -30]
print(has_negative_balance(operations))  # Output: True
```
### Explanation

1. Initialize a `balance` variable to keep track of the current balance.
2. Iterate through each operation in the list.
3. Add the operation to the balance (deposit or withdrawal).
4. Check if the balance is less than zero after each operation. If it is, return `True`.
5. If the loop completes without finding a negative balance, return `False`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations in the list.

Certainly! You can solve this problem by iterating through the list of transactions and maintaining a running total of the account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, you return "Yes". If you finish processing all transactions without the balance falling below zero, you return "No". Here's a Python function to achieve this:

```python
def is_account_negative(transactions):
    balance = 0
    for transaction in transactions:
        balance += transaction
        if balance < 0:
            return "Yes"
    return "No"

# Example usage:
transactions = [100, -50, -60, 20, -10]
print(is_account_negative(transactions))  # Output: "Yes"
```

In this code:
- We initialize `balance` to 0.
- We iterate over each transaction in the list.
- We update the `balance` by adding the current transaction amount.
- We check if the `balance` is less than zero after each transaction. If it is, we return "Yes".
- If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, we return "No".

**Extracted Code:**
def is_account_negative(transactions):
    balance = 0
    for transaction in transactions:
        balance += transaction
        if balance < 0:
            return "Yes"
    return "No"

# Example usage:
transactions = [100, -50, -60, 20, -10]
print(is_account_negative(transactions))  # Output: "Yes"

        if balance < 0:
            return "Yes"
    
    return "No"

# Example transactions
transactions = [('credit', 100), ('debit', 50), ('debit', 70), ('credit', 30)]

print(detect_negative_balance(transactions))  # Output: Yes

# Example test cases

    print(check_negative_balance([10, -20, 15, -10]))  # Should return "Yes"

# Run tests
test_check_negative_balance()
```

This solution:

1. Takes a list of transactions as input where:
   - Positive numbers represent credits (money added)
   - Negative numbers represent debits (money subtracted)

2. Maintains a running balance by adding each transaction

3. Checks if the balance goes negative at any point

4. Returns:
   - "Yes" if the balance ever goes below zero
   - "No" if the balance stays at or above zero throughout

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of transactions.
The space complexity is O(1) as we only need one variable to track the balance.

Example outputs:
```
Yes    # [10, -15, 5] -> balance goes to -5 after second transaction
No     # [100, -20, -30, -10] -> balance stays positive
No     # [10, -10] -> balance goes to 0 but never negative
Yes    # [-5] -> immediately goes negative
No     # [] -> empty list, starts at 0
Yes    # [10, -20, 15, -10] -> goes negative after second transaction
```

You can add more test cases or modify the existing ones based on your specific requirements.

**Detecting Negative Account Balances**
======================================

Here is a Python function that solves the problem:
```python
def detect_negative_balance(transactions):
    """
    Detects if an account balance falls under zero at any point given a list of transactions.

    Args:
        transactions (list): A list of integers representing account credits and debits.

    Returns:

    """
    balance = 0

        if balance < 0:
            return "Yes"
    return "No"
```
**Example Use Cases**
--------------------

```python
# Example 1: Account balance never falls under zero
transactions = [100, -50, 20, -10]
print(detect_negative_balance(transactions))  # Output: No

# Example 2: Account balance falls under zero
transactions = [100, -150, 20, -10]
print(detect_negative_balance(transactions))  # Output: Yes
```
**Explanation**

The function `detect_negative_balance` initializes a variable `balance` to 0 and then iterates over the list of transactions. For each transaction, it adds the transaction amount to the balance. If at any point the balance falls under zero, the function immediately returns "Yes". If the loop completes without finding a negative balance, the function returns "No".

Note that this implementation assumes that the input transactions are valid (i.e., they represent credits or debits) and do not contain invalid values such as non-numeric data.

Certainly! You can solve this problem by iterating through the list of financial activities and maintaining a running total. If at any point the running total falls below zero, you return `True`. If you finish iterating through the list without the total falling below zero, you return `False`. Here's a Python function to achieve this:

    return False

# Example usage:
activities = [100, -50, -60, 20, -10]
print(is_balance_negative(activities))  # Output: True
```

In this code:
- `activities` is a list of integers representing financial activities (positive for income, negative for expenses).
- `current_sum` keeps track of the running total.
- The loop iterates through each activity, updating the `current_sum`.
- If `current_sum` falls below zero at any point, the function returns `True`.
- If the loop completes without the sum falling below zero, the function returns `False`.

        return False
        
    except TypeError as e:
        raise TypeError(f"Invalid input: {str(e)}")
```

Example usage:

```python
# Test cases
print(falls_below_zero([100, -50, -60]))  # True (falls to -10)
print(falls_below_zero([100, -40, -50]))  # False (lowest is 10)
print(falls_below_zero([-50, 100]))       # True (starts at -50)
print(falls_below_zero([50, 50, -20]))    # False (never below 0)
print(falls_below_zero([]))               # False (empty list)

# With the error handling version:
try:
    print(falls_below_zero([100, "50", -60]))  # Raises TypeError
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)
```

Key features of the code:

1. The basic version:
   - Simple and straightforward implementation
   - Takes a list of numbers as input
   - Returns True/False based on whether the running sum ever goes below zero

2. The error-handling version:
   - Includes input validation
   - Handles type errors
   - Provides more detailed error messages
   - Includes docstring with usage information

The function keeps track of the running sum and checks at each step whether it has fallen below zero. As soon as it detects a negative balance, it returns True. If it completes the iteration without finding a negative balance, it returns False.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input list
Space Complexity: O(1) as it only uses a single variable for tracking

This code can be useful for:
- Bank balance checking
- Credit limit monitoring
- Resource usage tracking
- Budget planning

**Detecting Negative Balance**
=====================================

Here is a Python function that solves the problem:

```python
def has_negative_balance(entries):
    """
    Detects if the current sum falls below zero at any point in the given list of entries.

    Args:
        entries (list): A list of integers representing financial activities.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the current sum falls below zero, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0
    for entry in entries:
        balance += entry
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

**Example Use Cases**
--------------------

```python
# Test case with negative balance
entries1 = [100, -150, 50]
print(has_negative_balance(entries1))  # Output: True

# Test case without negative balance
entries2 = [100, 50, 200]
print(has_negative_balance(entries2))  # Output: False
```

**Explanation**
---------------

The function iterates over the list of entries, keeping a running total (`balance`) of the financial activities. If at any point the `balance` falls below zero, the function immediately returns `True`. If the iteration completes without finding a negative balance, the function returns `False`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of entries in the list, making it efficient for large inputs.

Certainly! You can solve this problem by iterating through the list of balance changes and maintaining a running total. If at any point the running total becomes negative, you return `True`. If you finish iterating through the list without the running total falling below zero, you return `False`. Here's a Python function to achieve this:

```python
def is_balance_negative(changes):
    running_total = 0
    for change in changes:
        running_total += change
        if running_total < 0:
            return True
    return False

# Example usage:
balance_changes = [100, -50, -60, 20, -10]
print(is_balance_negative(balance_changes))  # Output: True
```

In this example, the function `is_balance_negative` takes a list of balance changes as input and returns `True` if the running total ever falls below zero, otherwise it returns `False`.

**Extracted Code:**
def is_balance_negative(changes):
    running_total = 0

Here's a Python solution to detect if a running balance falls below zero at any point:

```python
def check_negative_balance(transactions):
    balance = 0
    
    for transaction in transactions:
        balance += transaction
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    
    return False

# Example usage and test cases
def test_check_negative_balance():
    # Test case 1: Balance never goes negative
    assert check_negative_balance([10, -5, 7, -3]) == False
    
    # Test case 2: Balance goes negative
    assert check_negative_balance([10, -15, 7, -3]) == True
    
    # Test case 3: Empty list
    assert check_negative_balance([]) == False
    
    # Test case 4: Single positive transaction
    assert check_negative_balance([5]) == False
    
    # Test case 5: Single negative transaction
    assert check_negative_balance([-5]) == True
    
    # Test case 6: Balance exactly zero

    assert check_negative_balance([2, -3, 5, -10, 8]) == True
    
    print("All test cases passed!")

# Run tests
test_check_negative_balance()
```

This solution:

1. Takes a list of transactions as input where:
   - Positive numbers represent credits (additions to balance)
   - Negative numbers represent debits (subtractions from balance)

2. Maintains a running balance by adding each transaction

3. Checks if the balance becomes negative at any point

4. Returns True if the balance ever goes negative, False otherwise

Key features:
- Simple and efficient: O(n) time complexity where n is the number of transactions
- Handles empty lists
- Handles single transactions
- Handles multiple transactions
- Handles edge cases like zero balance

Example usage:
```python
# Balance stays positive
print(check_negative_balance([10, -5, 7, -3]))  # Output: False

# Balance goes negative after second transaction
print(check_negative_balance([10, -15, 7, -3]))  # Output: True

# Empty list
print(check_negative_balance([]))  # Output: False

# Single negative transaction
print(check_negative_balance([-5]))  # Output: True
```

The test cases cover various scenarios:
1. Normal case where balance stays positive
2. Case where balance goes negative
3. Empty list
4. Single positive transaction
5. Single negative transaction
6. Balance exactly zero
7. Multiple points where balance could go negative

You can add more test cases as needed for your specific use case.

    balance = 0

**Detect Negative Balance**
=====================================

Here's a simple Python function that checks if a list of balance changes will result in a negative balance at any point:

```python
def detect_negative_balance(changes):
    """
    Detects if a sequence of account credits and debits results in a negative balance.

    Args:
        changes (list): A list of integers representing account credits (positive) and debits (negative).

    Returns:
        bool: True if the running total falls below zero, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0
    for change in changes:
        balance += change
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

**Example Use Cases**
--------------------

```python
# Test case with a negative balance
print(detect_negative_balance([100, -150, 50]))  # Output: True

# Test case without a negative balance
print(detect_negative_balance([100, -50, 50]))  # Output: False
```

This function works by maintaining a running total (balance) and updating it with each change in the input list. If at any point the balance falls below zero, the function immediately returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` after iterating through all changes.

**Step-by-Step Solution**
-------------------------

1. Initialize a variable `balance` to keep track of the running total.
2. Iterate through each change in the input list.
3. For each change, update the balance by adding the change value.
4. Check if the updated balance is less than zero. If so, return `True`.
5. After iterating through all changes, return `False` if no negative balances were found.

Note: This function assumes that the input list only contains integers representing account credits (positive) and debits (negative).

Certainly! You can solve this problem by iterating through the list of operations and maintaining a running balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, you return "Yes". If you finish processing all operations without the balance going below zero, you return "No". Here's a Python function to achieve this:

```python
def is_balance_negative(operations):
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return "Yes"
    return "No"

# Example usage:
operations = [10, -5, -10, 5, -1]
print(is_balance_negative(operations))  # Output: "Yes"
```

In this code:
- We initialize `balance` to 0.
- We iterate over each operation in the `operations` list.
- We update the `balance` by adding the current operation.
- We check if the `balance` is less than 0. If it is, we return "Yes".
- If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, we return "No".

**Extracted Code:**
def is_balance_negative(operations):
    balance = 0

        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:

    print("Test 6:", check_negative_balance(test6))  # Should print "Yes"

# Run the tests
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_check_negative_balance()
```

This solution:

1. Takes a list of operations as input where:
   - Positive numbers represent deposits/credits
   - Negative numbers represent withdrawals/debits

2. Maintains a running balance by adding each operation

3. Checks after each operation if the balance becomes negative

4. Returns:
   - "Yes" if the balance goes negative at any point
   - "No" if the balance stays non-negative throughout

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of operations, as we need to process each operation at most once.
The space complexity is O(1) as we only need to store the running balance.

Example outputs:
```
Test 1: Yes    # Balance goes: 5 → -5 → -1
Test 2: No     # Balance goes: 10 → 5 → 9
Test 3: No     # Balance goes: 5 → 0 → 5
Test 4: No     # Empty list, starting balance of 0 never changes
Test 5: Yes    # Balance immediately goes to -5
Test 6: Yes    # Balance goes: 10 → -5 → 5 → -15
```

You can also use it with your own test cases like this:
```python
custom_operations = [100, -20, -50, -40]
result = check_negative_balance(custom_operations)
print(result)  # Will print "No"
```

The code is easily modifiable if you need to:
- Start with a different initial balance
- Change the output format
- Add additional conditions
- Track when exactly the balance went negative

    balance = 0
