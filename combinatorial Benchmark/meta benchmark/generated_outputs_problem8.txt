Certainly! You can achieve this by defining a function that calculates the sum and product of a list of integers. Here's a Python function that does that:

```python
def sum_and_product(lst):
    # Calculate the sum of the list
    total_sum = sum(lst)
    
    # Calculate the product of the list
    total_product = 1
    for num in lst:
        total_product *= num
    
    return (total_sum, total_product)

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result = sum_and_product(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: (10, 24)

# Example with an empty list:
empty_list = []
result_empty = sum_and_product(empty_list)
print(result_empty)  # Output: (0, 1)
```

This function works by using Python's built-in `sum()` function to calculate the sum of the list. For the product, it initializes `total_product` to 1 and multiplies each element in the list. If the list is empty, the sum will naturally be 0 (as `sum([])` is 0), and the product will remain 1, as initialized.

**Extracted Code:**
def sum_and_product(lst):
    # Calculate the sum of the list
    total_sum = sum(lst)
    
    # Calculate the product of the list
    total_product = 1
    for num in lst:
        total_product *= num
    
    return (total_sum, total_product)

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result = sum_and_product(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: (10, 24)

# Example with an empty list:
empty_list = []
result_empty = sum_and_product(empty_list)
print(result_empty)  # Output: (0, 1)

Here's a Python solution for calculating the sum and product of elements in a list:

```python
def sum_and_product(numbers):
    if not numbers:  # If the list is empty
        return (0, 1)
    
    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    
    # Calculate product using a loop
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    
    return (total_sum, product)
```

Alternative solution using `math.prod` (Python 3.8+):
```python
from math import prod

def sum_and_product(numbers):
    return (sum(numbers) if numbers else 0, 
            prod(numbers) if numbers else 1)
```

These functions:
1. Take a list of integers as input
2. Return a tuple containing:
   - First element: sum of all numbers (0 for empty list)
   - Second element: product of all numbers (1 for empty list)

Example usage:
```python
# Test cases
print(sum_and_product([1, 2, 3]))      # Output: (6, 6)
print(sum_and_product([]))             # Output: (0, 1)
print(sum_and_product([5]))            # Output: (5, 5)
print(sum_and_product([-2, 4, 3]))     # Output: (5, -24)
```

The first solution uses a basic loop to calculate the product, which works in all Python versions. The second solution uses the `prod()` function from the `math` module, which was introduced in Python 3.8. Both solutions handle empty lists correctly by returning (0, 1).

Choose the version that best fits your needs based on:
1. Your Python version (if using < 3.8, use the first solution)
2. Code readability preference
3. Performance requirements (both solutions have similar performance characteristics)

**Extracted Code:**
def sum_and_product(numbers):
    if not numbers:  # If the list is empty
        return (0, 1)
    
    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    
    # Calculate product using a loop
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    
    return (total_sum, product)

**Sum and Product of List Elements**
=====================================

Here is a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing their sum and product:

```python
def sum_and_product(numbers):
    """
    Returns a tuple containing the sum and product of all elements in the input list.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the sum and product of the input list.
    """
    total = 0 if not numbers else sum(numbers)
    product = 1 if not numbers else prod(numbers)

    return total, product

from math import prod
```

**Example Use Cases**
--------------------

```python
print(sum_and_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: (10, 24)
print(sum_and_product([-1, 0, 1]))  # Output: (0, 0)
print(sum_and_product([]))  # Output: (0, 1)
```

In this code:

*   We define a function `sum_and_product` that takes a list of integers as input.
*   Inside the function, we use conditional expressions to calculate the sum and product of the input list. If the list is empty, we set the sum to 0 and the product to 1.
*   We then return a tuple containing the calculated sum and product.

The `prod` function from the `math` module is used to calculate the product of all elements in the input list. This function is available in Python 3.8 and later versions. If you are using an earlier version, you can replace it with your own implementation of a product function or upgrade to a newer version of Python.

This solution follows standard professional guidelines for code readability and conciseness while ensuring the correctness of the result.

Certainly! You can achieve this by iterating through the list and calculating both the product and the cumulative sum. Here's a Python function that does that:

```python
def calculate_product_and_cumulative_sum(numbers):
    product = 1
    cumulative_sum = 0
    
    for number in numbers:
        product *= number
        cumulative_sum += number
    
    return (product, cumulative_sum)

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result = calculate_product_and_cumulative_sum(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: (24, 10)
```

This function initializes `product` to 1 and `cumulative_sum` to 0. It then iterates over each number in the list, updating the product and cumulative sum accordingly. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the product and the cumulative sum. If the list is empty, the function will correctly return `(1, 0)`.

**Extracted Code:**
def calculate_product_and_cumulative_sum(numbers):
    product = 1
    cumulative_sum = 0
    
    for number in numbers:
        product *= number
        cumulative_sum += number
    
    return (product, cumulative_sum)

```python
def product_and_sum(numbers):
    # Handle empty list case

    # Calculate product
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    
    # Calculate cumulative sum

```

Alternative solution using the `math.prod()` function (available in Python 3.8+):

```python
from math import prod

def product_and_sum(numbers):
    return (prod(numbers) if numbers else 1, sum(numbers))
```

Example usage:

print(product_and_sum([2, 3]))           # Output: (6, 5)
```

Both solutions:
1. Accept a list of numbers as input
2. Return a tuple containing:
   - The product of all numbers (or 1 if the list is empty)
   - The cumulative sum of all numbers (or 0 if the list is empty)
3. Handle empty lists correctly

The first solution is more explicit and works in all Python versions, while the second solution is more concise but requires Python 3.8 or later due to the use of `math.prod()`.

Key features:
- Both solutions handle empty lists correctly
- Both return results as a tuple
- Both work with integers and floating-point numbers
- Both are efficient for typical use cases

Choose the first solution if you need compatibility with older Python versions, or the second solution if you prefer more concise code and are using Python 3.8+.

Certainly! You can achieve this by defining a function that calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list and also finds the minimum value. If the list is empty, the difference should be 0, and the minimum should be positive infinity. Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
def calculate_difference_and_minimum(values):
    if not values:
        return (0, float('inf'))
    
    min_value = min(values)
    max_value = max(values)
    difference = max_value - min_value
    
    return (difference, min_value)

# Example usage:
values = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]
result = calculate_difference_and_minimum(values)
print(result)  # Output: (8, 1)

# Example with an empty list:
empty_values = []
result_empty = calculate_difference_and_minimum(empty_values)
print(result_empty)  # Output: (0, inf)
```

This function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a tuple with 0 for the difference and positive infinity for the minimum. If the list is not empty, it calculates the minimum and maximum values, computes their difference, and returns the result as a tuple.

**Extracted Code:**
def calculate_difference_and_minimum(values):
    if not values:
        return (0, float('inf'))
    
    min_value = min(values)

    difference = max_value - min_value

# Example usage:

This solution:

1. Takes a list of values as input

2. Has two special cases:
   - If the list is empty, returns (0, float('inf'))
   - If the list has one element, difference will be 0 and minimum will be that element

3. For non-empty lists:
   - Calculates the minimum using min()
   - Calculates the maximum using max()
   - Calculates the difference (maximum - minimum)
   - Returns a tuple with (difference, minimum)

4. Works with:
   - Empty lists
   - Lists with single elements
   - Lists with multiple elements
   - Lists with positive numbers
   - Lists with negative numbers
   - Lists with floating-point numbers

The included test cases verify the function works correctly for various scenarios.

Example usage:
```python

```

This code defines a function `calculate_difference_and_min` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the list and the minimum element itself.

Certainly! You can achieve this by defining a function in Python that calculates the average and maximum of a list of elements. Here's a sample implementation:

```python
def calculate_average_and_maximum(elements):
    if not elements:
        return (0, float('-inf'))
    
    average = sum(elements) / len(elements)
    maximum = max(elements)
    
    return (average, maximum)

# Example usage:
elements = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = calculate_average_and_maximum(elements)
print(result)  # Output: (3.0, 5)

# Example with an empty list:
empty_elements = []
empty_result = calculate_average_and_maximum(empty_elements)
print(empty_result)  # Output: (0, -inf)
```

This function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a tuple with the average as `0` and the maximum as negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). If the list is not empty, it calculates the average by summing the elements and dividing by the number of elements, and finds the maximum using the `max()` function.

**Extracted Code:**
def calculate_average_and_maximum(elements):
    if not elements:
        return (0, float('-inf'))
    
    average = sum(elements) / len(elements)
    maximum = max(elements)
    
    return (average, maximum)

# Example usage:
elements = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = calculate_average_and_maximum(elements)
print(result)  # Output: (3.0, 5)

# Example with an empty list:

empty_result = calculate_average_and_maximum(empty_elements)

# Example usage

You can call the `calculate_avg_max` function with a list of elements as input, and it will return a tuple containing the average and maximum of the elements in the list. If the list is empty, it will return (0, float('-inf')) as specified.

Here's a Python solution to find the average and maximum of a list of elements:

```python
def avg_max(lst):
    if not lst:  # if list is empty
        return (0, float('-inf'))
    
    return (sum(lst) / len(lst), max(lst))
```

This solution:
1. Takes a list `lst` as input
2. Checks if the list is empty using `if not lst`
3. If empty, returns a tuple with 0 as average and negative infinity as maximum
4. If not empty, returns a tuple containing:
   - The average (calculated using `sum(lst) / len(lst)`)
   - The maximum (found using `max(lst)`)

Here are some example test cases:

```python
# Test cases
print(avg_max([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: (3.0, 5)
print(avg_max([]))  # Output: (0, -inf)
print(avg_max([1]))  # Output: (1.0, 1)
print(avg_max([-1, -2, -3]))  # Output: (-2.0, -1)
print(avg_max([1.5, 2.5, 3.5]))  # Output: (2.5, 3.5)
```

Alternative implementation using built-in statistics module:

```python
from statistics import mean

def avg_max(lst):
    if not lst:
        return (0, float('-inf'))
    
    return (mean(lst), max(lst))
```

Both implementations will give the same results, but the second one uses the `statistics.mean()` function which might be more explicit in its intention. The first implementation is more straightforward and doesn't require importing additional modules.

The function handles:
- Empty lists
- Lists with single elements
- Lists with multiple elements
- Lists with positive numbers
- Lists with negative numbers
- Lists with floating-point numbers

Remember that the function assumes all elements in the list are numbers (integers or floats). If the list contains non-numeric elements, you'll need to add error handling.

**Extracted Code:**
def avg_max(lst):
    if not lst:  # if list is empty
        return (0, float('-inf'))

# Test case 2: empty list
empty_list = []
avg, max_val = avg_max(empty_list)
print(avg)  # Output: 0
print(max_val)  # Output: -inf
```
This solution uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of all elements in the list and then divides it by the length of the list to get the average. The `max` function is used to find the maximum value in the list.

If the input list is empty, the function returns a tuple containing 0 as the average and negative infinity as the maximum value.

Note that this implementation uses the `math.inf` constant to represent infinity, which is available in Python 3.5 and later versions. In earlier versions of Python, you can use `float('inf')` instead.

Certainly! You can achieve this by iterating through the list to calculate the cumulative sum and the maximum value. Here's a Python function that does exactly that:

```python
def cumulative_sum_and_max(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return (0, float('-inf'))
    
    cumulative_sum = 0
    max_value = float('-inf')
    
    for number in numbers:
        cumulative_sum += number
        if number > max_value:
            max_value = number
    
    return (cumulative_sum, max_value)

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = cumulative_sum_and_max(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: (15, 5)
```

This function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a tuple with 0 as the cumulative sum and negative infinity as the maximum. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, updating the cumulative sum and the maximum value as it goes. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the cumulative sum and the maximum value.

print(cumsum_and_max([1.5, 2.5, 3.5]))      # Output: (7.5, 3.5)
```

Both implementations will work correctly. The first implementation is more concise and readable, using Python's built-in `sum()` and `max()` functions. The second implementation uses a single loop to calculate both values simultaneously, which could be more efficient for very large lists since it only needs to iterate through the list once.

Key features of the solution:

1. Handles empty lists by returning (0, -infinity)
2. Works with both integer and floating-point numbers
3. Returns a tuple with two values: (cumulative sum, maximum)
4. Properly handles negative numbers
5. Type hints are included for better code readability and IDE support

Choose the first implementation if code readability and maintainability are priorities, or the second implementation if performance with large lists is a concern.

This function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a tuple with cumulative sum equal to 0 and maximum equal to negative infinity.

If the list is not empty, it initializes two variables `cumsum` and `max_num` to keep track of the cumulative sum and the maximum number seen so far. It then iterates over each number in the list, updating `cumsum` by adding the current number and `max_num` by taking the maximum of the current number and `max_num`.

Finally, it returns a tuple containing the calculated cumulative sum and maximum.
